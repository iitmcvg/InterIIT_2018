This is the submission by the team from IIT Madras which participated in Inter IIT Tech Meet 2018 conducted by IIT Bombay.


## Problem statement

The goal was to achieve satellite image segmentation using a training dataset of only *14* images, of size approx 1200x1200.   
The output image pixels had to be segmented into 8 classes ( or as background):
Swimming Pool, Oceans, Grasslands, Forests, Roads, Railways, Bare soil and Buildings.
More details are available in the Problem-Statement pdf.

## Our Solution

We used a mixture of pure computer vision techniques and deep learning approaches for the problem. Our approach was to obtain binary segmentation maps class-wise. Details are mentioned in the report.
